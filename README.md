# watchtips

This is an experiment to see if  can use Flutter to build an iOS app with an accompanying watchOS app. My first attempts using the beta prpduct were not successful so the idea was parked.
Having now re-visited this I can now get a compiled blank watch app up and running with a Flutter app, so I will, in stages, try and re-create the WatchTips app using Flutter.

My plan is to:

- *1.0* Create a vanilla Flutter app (this initial commit)
- *1.1* Add a blank watch project and get it working
- *1.2* Modify the watch app functionally into WatchTips
- *1.3* Update the Flutter app to WatchTips
- *1.4* See if I can bridge between the 2 app (as the Titanium version does)
